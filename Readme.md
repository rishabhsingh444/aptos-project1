- **Token Rewards**: Students receive token rewards based on the time spent studying. Rewards are transferred securely and transparently using smart contracts.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Study sessions and rewards are tracked and managed on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.

## Future Scope
- **Custom Reward System**: Allow educators or institutions to set custom reward rates based on the subject or difficulty of the study session.
- **Leaderboard**: Implement a global or group leaderboard to track study hours and encourage competition among students.
- **Integration with Other Educational Platforms**: Extend the platformâ€™s functionality by integrating with existing online learning systems, providing a seamless experience for students.
- **NFT Badges**: Issue NFT-based badges for achieving specific study milestones to further motivate students.
